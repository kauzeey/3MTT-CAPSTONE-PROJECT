## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact globally. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data from various countries to understand the spread of the virus and develop predictive models that can help in decision-making processes.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and contains the following columns:

- **Country/Region**: The name of the country or region.
- **Continent**: The continent where the country is located.
- **Population**: The total population of the country.
- **TotalCases**: The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **NewCases**: The number of new confirmed cases.
- **TotalDeaths**: The total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
- **NewDeaths**: The number of new deaths reported.
- **TotalRecovered**: The total number of recovered cases.
- **NewRecovered**: The number of new recoveries reported.
- **ActiveCases**: The current number of active cases.
  
The dataset can be found in the `worldometer_data.csv` file included in this repository.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required packages. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage

    Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-data-analysis.git
    cd covid19-data-analysis

Open a Jupyter Notebook or Python script and run the analysis:

python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('worldometer_data.csv')

    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build machine learning models as outlined in the notebooks.

Exploratory Data Analysis
This section includes various visualizations and statistical analyses to understand trends in COVID-19 data, such as:

    Time series analysis of total cases and deaths.
    Correlation analysis between different variables.
    Distribution plots for cases per million population.

Machine Learning Model
In this section, we build a machine learning model to predict total COVID-19 cases based on selected features such as population, total deaths, and total recovered. The model evaluation metrics used include:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    R-squared (RÂ²)

Example Code Snippet

python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Prepare features and target variable
X = data[['Population', 'TotalDeaths', 'TotalRecovered', 'ActiveCases']]
y = data['TotalCases']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R-squared: {r2}')
